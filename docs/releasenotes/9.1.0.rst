API Additions
=============

Added get_photoshop_blocks() to parse Photoshop TIFF tag
--------------------------------------------------------

:py:meth:`~PIL.TiffImagePlugin.TiffImageFile.get_photoshop_blocks` has been added, to
allow users to determine what Photoshop "Image Resource Blocks" are contained within an
image. The keys of the returned dictionary are the image resource IDs.

At present, the information within each block is merely returned as a dictionary with a
"data" entry. This will allow more useful information to be added in the future without
breaking backwards compatibility.
